# TypeScript React Todo App

Minimal responsive todo app built with React, TypeScript and Vite.

## Setup

From the project root (`testApp`):

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open it in your browser.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Then you can preview the production build with:

```bash
npm run preview
```
